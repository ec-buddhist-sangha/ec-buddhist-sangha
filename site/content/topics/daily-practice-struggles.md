How do you all maintain a 20-minute daily sit when the kids are home? I've been struggling to find consistent time in the mornings before work. 

I've tried:
- Waking up 30 minutes earlier (hard when the kids wake up early too)
- Sitting in the evening (I'm too tired)
- Short 10-minute sits (helpful but not the same)

Would love to hear what works for other parents in the sangha.
