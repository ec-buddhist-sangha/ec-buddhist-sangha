We have added five new titles to our community library, including Pema Chödrön's latest work on living with compassion and uncertainty.

New titles include:
- *Living Beautifully with Uncertainty and Change* by Pema Chödrön
- *The Art of Gathering* by Priya Krishna
- *Stillness Speaks* by Eckhart Tolle

Feel free to browse and borrow after our Tuesday meetings. Our library is a free resource for all sangha members.
