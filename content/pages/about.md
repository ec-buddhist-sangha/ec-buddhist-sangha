## About the Eau Claire Buddhist Sangha

A Buddhist community that meets to meditate together and study the dharma, the teachings of the Buddha.

The Eau Claire Buddhist Sangha is a peer-led sangha, with occasional guidance from teachers in the Vipassana and Zen traditions of Buddhism. Everyone is welcome, whether you study and practice in a particular lineage of Buddhism or practice with another faith tradition. Participants come from all walks of life and all faith traditions.

## Weekly Schedule

We meet on Tuesday evenings. Each 90 minute gathering is divided into 30 minute segments.

- **7:00 PM:** Group meditation with instruction for newcomers
- **7:30 PM:** Recorded Dharma talk from a teacher presented by one of the members
- **8:00 PM:** Open discussion about the teachings and meditation practice

Cushions, chairs, and blankets are available for meditation support. Through practice, learning, and dialogue, we support our own and each others' practice and intentions to follow the path to live a skillful, compassionate life.

## Dana

Our sangha is supported through Dana. There is no fee to attend the weekly gatherings, but all are invited to offer Dana, the generosity of those who attend and support the community. Dana may be in the form of a donation of time, talent, or financial resources toward the flourishing of the sangha.
